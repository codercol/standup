- No changes.

## Rails 6.0.3.1 (May 18, 2020)

- No changes.

## Rails 6.0.3 (May 06, 2020)

- Cache compiled view templates when running tests by default

  When generating a new app without `--skip-spring`, caching classes is
  disabled in `environments/test.rb`. This implicitly disables caching
  view templates too. This change will enable view template caching by
  adding this to the generated `environments/test.rb`:

  ```ruby
  config.action_view.cache_template_loading = true
  ```

  _Jorge Manrubia_

- `Rails::Application#eager_load!` is available again to load application code
  manually as it was possible in previous versions.

  Please, note this is not integrated with the whole eager loading logic that
  runs when Rails boots with eager loading enabled, you can think of this
  method as a vanilla recursive code loader.

  This ability has been restored because there are some use cases for it, such
  as indexers that need to have all application classes and modules in memory.

  _Xavier Noria_

- Generators that inherit from NamedBase respect `--force` option

  _Josh Brody_

- Regression fix: The Rake task `zeitwerk:check` supports eager loaded
  namespaces which do not have eager load paths, like the recently added
  `i18n`. These namespaces are only required to respond to `eager_load!`.

  _Xavier Noria_

## Rails 6.0.2.2 (March 19, 2020)

- No changes.

## Rails 6.0.3.2 (December 18, 2019)

- No changes.

## Rails 6.0.2 (December 13, 2019)

- Fix the collision check for the scaffold generator.

  _Ryan Robeson_

## Rails 6.0.1 (November 5, 2019)

- The `zeitwerk:check` Rake task reports files outside the app's root
  directory, as in engines loaded from gems.

  _Xavier Noria_

- Fixed a possible error when using the evented file update checker.

  _Yuji Yaginuma_

- The sqlite3 database files created by the parallel testing feature are
  included in the default `.gitignore` file for newly-generated apps.

  _Yasuo Honda_

- `rails new` generates a `.keep` file in `tmp/pids`. This fixes starting
  a server via `rackup` instead of `rails server`.

  _Rafael Mendonça França_

## Rails 6.0.0 (August 16, 2019)

- `Rails.autoloaders.log!` is a logging shortcut to get the activity of the
  loaders printed to standard output. May be handy for troubleshooting.

  _Xavier Noria_

## Rails 6.0.0.rc2 (July 22, 2019)

- The new configuration point `config.add_autoload_paths_to_load_path` allows
  users to opt-out from adding autoload paths to `$LOAD_PATH`. This flag is
  `true` by default, but it is recommended to be set to `false` in `:zeitwerk`
  mode early, in `config/application.rb`.

  Zeitwerk uses only absolute paths internally, and applications running in
  `:zeitwerk` mode do not need `require_dependency`, so models, controllers,
  jobs, etc. do not need to be in `$LOAD_PATH`. Setting this to `false` saves
  Ruby from checking these directories when resolving `require` calls with
  relative paths, and saves Bootsnap work and RAM, since it does not need to
  build an index for them.

  _Xavier Noria_

## Rails 6.0.0.rc1 (April 24, 2019)

- Applications upgrading to Rails 6 can run the command

  ```
  bin/rails zeitwerk:check
  ```

  to check if the project structure they were using with the classic
  autoloader is compatible with `:zeitwerk` mode.

  _Matilda Smeds_ & _Xavier Noria_

- Allow loading seeds without ActiveJob.

  Fixes #35782

  _Jeremy Weathers_

- `null: false` is set in the migrations by default for column pointed by
  `belongs_to` / `references` association generated by model generator.

  Also deprecate passing {required} to the model generator.

  _Prathamesh Sonpatki_

- New applications get `config.cache_classes = false` in `config/environments/test.rb`
  unless `--skip-spring`.

  _Xavier Noria_

- Autoloading during initialization is deprecated.

  _Xavier Noria_

- Only force `:async` ActiveJob adapter to `:inline` during seeding.

  _BatedUrGonnaDie_

- The `connection` option of `rails dbconsole` command is deprecated in
  favor of `database` option.

  _Yuji Yaginuma_

- Replace `chromedriver-helper` gem with `webdrivers` in default Gemfile.
  `chromedriver-helper` is deprecated as of March 31, 2019 and won't
  receive any further updates.

  _Guillermo Iguaran‮_

- Applications running in `:zeitwerk` mode that use `bootsnap` need
  to upgrade `bootsnap` to at least 1.4.2.

  _Xavier Noria_

- Add `config.disable_sandbox` option to Rails console.

  This setting will disable `rails console --sandbox` mode, preventing
  developer from accidentally starting a sandbox console,
  which when left inactive, can cause the database server to run out of memory.

  _Prem Sichanugrist_

- Add `-e/--environment` option to `rails initializers`.

  _Yuji Yaginuma_

## Rails 6.0.0.beta3 (March 11, 2019)

- Generate random development secrets

  A random development secret is now generated to tmp/development_secret.txt

  This avoids an issue where development mode servers were vulnerable to
  remote code execution.

  Fixes CVE-2019-5420

  _Eileen M. Uchitelle_, _Aaron Patterson_, _John Hawthorn_

## Rails 6.0.0.beta2 (February 25, 2019)

- Fix non-symbol access to nested hashes returned from `Rails::Application.config_for`
  being broken by allowing non-symbol access with a deprecation notice.

  _Ufuk Kayserilioglu_

- Fix deeply nested namespace command printing.

  _Gannon McGibbon_

## Rails 6.0.0.beta1 (January 18, 2019)

- Remove deprecated `after_bundle` helper inside plugins templates.

  _Rafael Mendonça França_

- Remove deprecated support to old `config.ru` that use the application class as argument of `run`.

  _Rafael Mendonça França_

- Remove deprecated `environment` argument from the rails commands.

  _Rafael Mendonça França_

- Remove deprecated `capify!`.

  _Rafael Mendonça França_

- Remove deprecated `config.secret_token`.

  _Rafael Mendonça França_

- Seed database with inline ActiveJob job adapter.

  _Gannon McGibbon_

- Add `rails db:system:change` command for changing databases.

  ```
  bin/rails db:system:change --to=postgresql
     force  config/database.yml
      gsub  Gemfile
  ```

  The change command copies a template `config/database.yml` with
  the target database adapter into your app, and replaces your database gem
  with the target database gem.

  _Gannon McGibbon_

- Add `rails test:channels`.

  _bogdanvlviv_

- Use original `bundler` environment variables during the process of generating a new rails project.

  _Marco Costa_

- Send Active Storage analysis and purge jobs to dedicated queues by default.

  Analysis jobs now use the `:active_storage_analysis` queue, and purge jobs
  now use the `:active_storage_purge` queue. This matches Action Mailbox,
  which sends its jobs to dedicated queues by default.

  _George Claghorn_

- Add `rails test:mailboxes`.

  _George Claghorn_

- Introduce guard against DNS rebinding attacks.

  The `ActionDispatch::HostAuthorization` is a new middleware that prevents
  against DNS rebinding and other `Host` header attacks. It is included in
  the development environment by default with the following configuration:

      Rails.application.config.hosts = [
        IPAddr.new("0.0.0.0/0"), # All IPv4 addresses.
        IPAddr.new("::/0"),      # All IPv6 addresses.
        "localhost"              # The localhost reserved domain.
      ]

  In other environments `Rails.application.config.hosts` is empty and no
  `Host` header checks will be done. If you want to guard against header
  attacks on production, you have to manually permit the allowed hosts
  with:

      Rails.application.config.hosts << "product.com"

  The host of a request is checked against the `hosts` entries with the case
  operator (`#===`), which lets `hosts` support entries of type `Regexp`,
  `Proc` and `IPAddr` to name a few. Here is an example with a regexp.

      # Allow requests from subdomains like `www.product.com` and
      # `beta1.product.com`.
      Rails.application.config.hosts << /.*\.product\.com/

  A special case is supported that allows you to permit all sub-domains:

      # Allow requests from subdomains like `www.product.com` and
      # `beta1.product.com`.
      Rails.application.config.hosts << ".product.com"

  _Genadi Samokovarov_

- Remove redundant suffixes on generated helpers.

  _Gannon McGibbon_

- Remove redundant suffixes on generated integration tests.

  _Gannon McGibbon_

- Fix boolean interaction in scaffold system tests.

  _Gannon McGibbon_

- Remove redundant suffixes on generated system tests.

  _Gannon McGibbon_

- Add an `abort_on_failure` boolean option to the generator method that shell
  out (`generate`, `rake`, `rails_command`) to abort the generator if the
  command fails.

  _David Rodríguez_

- Remove `app/assets` and `app/javascript` from `eager_load_paths` and `autoload_paths`.

  _Gannon McGibbon_

- Use Ids instead of memory addresses when displaying references in scaffold views.

  Fixes #29200.

  _Rasesh Patel_

- Adds support for multiple databases to `rails db:migrate:status`.
  Subtasks are also added to get the status of individual databases (eg. `rails db:migrate:status:animals`).

  _Gannon McGibbon_

- Use Webpacker by default to manage app-level JavaScript through the new app/javascript directory.
  Sprockets is now solely in charge, by default, of compiling CSS and other static assets.
  Action Cable channel generators will create ES6 stubs rather than use CoffeeScript.
  Active Storage, Action Cable, Turbolinks, and Rails-UJS are loaded by a new application.js pack.
  Generators no longer generate JavaScript stubs.

  _DHH_, _Lachlan Sylvester_

- Add `database` (aliased as `db`) option to model generator to allow
  setting the database. This is useful for applications that use
  multiple databases and put migrations per database in their own directories.

  ```
  bin/rails g model Room capacity:integer --database=kingston
        invoke  active_record
        create    db/kingston_migrate/20180830151055_create_rooms.rb
  ```

  Because rails scaffolding uses the model generator, you can
  also specify a database with the scaffold generator.

  _Gannon McGibbon_

- Raise an error when "recyclable cache keys" are being used by a cache store
  that does not explicitly support it. Custom cache keys that do support this feature
  can bypass this error by implementing the `supports_cache_versioning?` method on their
  class and returning a truthy value.

  _Richard Schneeman_

- Support environment specific credentials overrides.

  So any environment will look for `config/credentials/#{Rails.env}.yml.enc` and fall back
  to `config/credentials.yml.enc`.

  The encryption key can be in `ENV["RAILS_MASTER_KEY"]` or `config/credentials/production.key`.

  Environment credentials overrides can be edited with `rails credentials:edit --environment production`.
  If no override is set up for the passed environment, it will be created.

  Additionally, the default lookup paths can be overwritten with these configs:

  - `config.credentials.content_path`
  - `config.credentials.key_path`

  _Wojciech Wnętrzak_

- Make `ActiveSupport::Cache::NullStore` the default cache store in the test environment.

  _Michael C. Nelson_

- Emit warning for unknown inflection rule when generating model.

  _Yoshiyuki Kinjo_

- Add `database` (aliased as `db`) option to migration generator.

  If you're using multiple databases and have a folder for each database
  for migrations (ex db/migrate and db/new_db_migrate) you can now pass the
  `--database` option to the generator to make sure the the migration
  is inserted into the correct folder.

  ```
  rails g migration CreateHouses --database=kingston
    invoke  active_record
    create    db/kingston_migrate/20180830151055_create_houses.rb
  ```

  _Eileen M. Uchitelle_

- Deprecate `rake routes` in favor of `rails routes`.

  _Yuji Yaginuma_

- Deprecate `rake initializers` in favor of `rails initializers`.

  _Annie-Claude Côté_

- Deprecate `rake dev:cache` in favor of `rails dev:cache`.

  _Annie-Claude Côté_

- Deprecate `rails notes` subcommands in favor of passing an `annotations` argument to `rails notes`.

  The following subcommands are replaced by passing `--annotations` or `-a` to `rails notes`:

  - `rails notes:custom ANNOTATION=custom` is deprecated in favor of using `rails notes -a custom`.
  - `rails notes:optimize` is deprecated in favor of using `rails notes -a OPTIMIZE`.
  - `rails notes:todo` is deprecated in favor of using`rails notes -a TODO`.
  - `rails notes:fixme` is deprecated in favor of using `rails notes -a FIXME`.

  _Annie-Claude Côté_

- Deprecate `SOURCE_ANNOTATION_DIRECTORIES` environment variable used by `rails notes`
  through `Rails::SourceAnnotationExtractor::Annotation` in favor of using `config.annotations.register_directories`.

  _Annie-Claude Côté_

- Deprecate `rake notes` in favor of `rails notes`.

  _Annie-Claude Côté_

- Don't generate unused files in `app:update` task.

  Skip the assets' initializer when sprockets isn't loaded.

  Skip `config/spring.rb` when spring isn't loaded.

  Skip yarn's contents when yarn integration isn't used.

  _Tsukuru Tanimichi_

- Make the master.key file read-only for the owner upon generation on
  POSIX-compliant systems.

  Previously:

      $ ls -l config/master.key
      -rw-r--r--   1 owner  group      32 Jan 1 00:00 master.key

  Now:

      $ ls -l config/master.key
      -rw-------   1 owner  group      32 Jan 1 00:00 master.key

  Fixes #32604.

  _Jose Luis Duran_

- Deprecate support for using the `HOST` environment variable to specify the server IP.

  The `BINDING` environment variable should be used instead.

  Fixes #29516.

  _Yuji Yaginuma_

- Deprecate passing Rack server name as a regular argument to `rails server`.

  Previously:

      $ bin/rails server thin

  There wasn't an explicit option for the Rack server to use, now we have the
  `--using` option with the `-u` short switch.

  Now:

      $ bin/rails server -u thin

  This change also improves the error message if a missing or mistyped rack
  server is given.

  _Genadi Samokovarov_

- Add "rails routes --expanded" option to output routes in expanded mode like
  "psql --expanded". Result looks like:

  ```
  $ rails routes --expanded
  --[ Route 1 ]------------------------------------------------------------
  Prefix            | high_scores
  Verb              | GET
  URI               | /high_scores(.:format)
  Controller#Action | high_scores#index
  --[ Route 2 ]------------------------------------------------------------
  Prefix            | new_high_score
  Verb              | GET
  URI               | /high_scores/new(.:format)
  Controller#Action | high_scores#new
  ```

  _Benoit Tigeot_

- Rails 6 requires Ruby 2.5.0 or newer.
